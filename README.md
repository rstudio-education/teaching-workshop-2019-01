## Day 1

1.  Getting Started (0:15/09:15)

1.  Two Ways to Teach (0:45/10:00)
    -   01-two-ways-to-teach.key
    -   Introductions
    -   Comparison with movie/play (add comedy improv)
    -   Tell participants there's lots of research (much of which people don't know/act on)
    -   Explain schedule for both days
    -   Explain what active learning is (creates a real-time feedback loop in class)
    -   Introduce cognitive architecture diagram (revisit it several times)
        -   Teaching is "load into short-term memory and keep it there long enough to be transferred"
    -   Bloom's Taxonomy
        -   Use revised version from early 2000s
        -   Google isn't enough if you don't know what to search for or how to recognize a useful answer when you find one
        -   GG added "awareness" to the bottom of the Bloom hierarchy since it's the most realistic goal for a workshop like this
    -   Exercise: classify three learning objectives by level

1.  Novice/Competent Practitioner/Expert (0:45/10:45)
    -   Mental models
        -   Emphasize linkages: we rarely forget completely, but we lose the ability to retrieve
    -   Mental models don't have to be right to be useful (ball-and-spring models in chemistry)
    -   Concept maps as visual representations of mental models
    -   Using concept maps:
        -   To design lesson
        -   To convey information to learners
        -   For insight into their learning
    -   Exercise: draw and compare concept maps for ggplot2

1.  Coffee (0:15/11:00)

1.  Teaching as Performance I (0:45/11:45)
    -   Critique the Nederbragt videos
        -   https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE
        -   https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY
    -   Exercise: teach in pairs (no recording)
    -   Build rubric for use in afternoon

1.  The Cognitive Craft (0:45/12:30)
    -   Revisit cognitive architecture diagram and introduce 7 +/- 2
    -   Lesson "scenes" should fit into working memory
        -   Use exercises/discussion/elaborative examples to keep new material there long enough to be transcribed
    -   Cognitive load theory (as is)
    -   Exercise: outline a faded example

1.  Lunch (0:45/13:15)

1.  Formative Assessment (0:30/13:45)
    -   Importance of feedback loop while teaching (for instructor as well as learners)
    -   MCQ example
    -   Dual purposes of formative assessments (feedback loop + reinforcement)
    -   Different kinds of formative assessment
    -   Exercise: create MCQ and explain misconceptions it diagnoses

1.  Teaching as Performance II (1:00/14:45)
    -   In threes (recorded) using morning rubric
    -   Lead up to the MCQ

1.  Coffee (0:15/15:00)

1.  Motivation (0:45/15:45)
    -   Three big motivators (self-efficacy, utility, community)
    -   Three big demotivators (unpredictability, unfairness, indifference)
    -   Zone of Proximal Development
    -   Exercise: what demotivates people in programming classes and how do we prevent/fix it?

1.  Multimedia Learning (0:45/16:30)
    -   Material drawn primarily from 04-Make-It-Clear.pdf
    -   Exercise: create a visual to explain what the course is about

1.  Wrapping Up/Looking Forward (0:30/17:00)
    -   Summarize what we have learned
    -   Gather open questions
    -   Remind participants of Day 2's agenda(s)
