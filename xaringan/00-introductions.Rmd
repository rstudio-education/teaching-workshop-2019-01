Welcome to Teach the Tidyverse and anything else.
We are going to spend today learning how to teach any subject effectively in a workshop format,
and tomorrow applying those ideas to teaching the tidy verse and shiny.

# Your Goals

1. Write down two things you hope to get out of this workshop.
1. Write down one thing about your own teaching practice that you think other people would find useful.

Keep these somewhere safe - we will return to these points at the end of the day.

As our first exercise,
please write down a couple of things you hope to get out of this workshop
and one thing about your own teaching practice that you think other people would find useful.
Hang onto these - we'll return to them at the end of the day.
